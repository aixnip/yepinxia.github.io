He canâ€™t remember whether he watched last weekâ€™s episode of Eureka. So he navigates to decision making data for the most recent episodes and confirms he did miss it. Angelo doesnâ€™t want to watch tonightâ€™s new episode before he has watched the last one. Zap2it tells him the last episode is available on Syfy. Angelo watches it on his tablet before the new episode airs on TV.</p>"
